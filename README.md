## Introduction

Walley Checkout provides a native WebView containing the Walley Checkout UI.

## Prerequisites

First of all you will need access to our environments. Contact Walley Merchant Services to acquire the following access credentials:

- Username
- Shared Access key
- Store Id

## Environment

For testing and staging purposes, Walley Merchant Services will setup an account in the UAT environment where you can test your implementation before moving to production.

The credentials (username, shared access key and store ID) will differ between the environments.

There are two environments:

- **Production** (All purchases are real and real money will be involved in transactions)
- **UAT** (No real money will be involved in transactions)
